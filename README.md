## Inspiration 🧜‍♀️
We were inspired by the idea of a modern lonely sailor. We thought to ourselves, "What would this sailor need to fulfill his navigation needs and thirst for a word puzzle?".

## What it does 🚢 🌧
Our project gathers real-time weather data and gets the most optimal path to get from one port to another. We created a list of ports that the user can choose from, which then shows an interactive map of the most optimal path between locations. Also, we included a Wordle-inspired game at the end, created by Sylvio himself!!

## How we built it ❓
For the website, it's run using Python and Streamlit. In this file (titled website.py), we used the OpenWeatherMap API to gather relevant weather data from the starting location and created a function to calculate the distance between a list of ports. The wordle-inspired "seaWorldLE" was built using PHP, CSS, a word bank, and HTML to blend the backend and front-end problems faced when making a game like Wordle.

## Challenges we ran into 😕
We ran into data collection issues at the start that made us rethink how we went about our project. Our initial idea was to collect data from the National Data Buoy Center, but after a couple of hours of not having the right access to gather this data, we decided to pivot. We then tried to implement an image classification model to predict what species a shark was based on a picture, but then quickly realized we didn't have any prior experience in any machine learning algorithms/concepts. So we _pivoted_ again, because we figured that the "3rd time's a charm." Additionally, in the mini-game seaWorldLE, we ran into issues with hosting a PHP website. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 😁
We're proud of the way we were able to recover from harsh setbacks in the beginning and rethink how we went about collecting our data. After struggling for about 10 hours (both with a conclusive idea and debugging) and contemplating giving up, we were able to muster up some confidence and dedicate ourselves to this one project, which we are very proud of doing.

## What we learned 🧠
Functionally, we learned how to constantly reinvigorate our imaginations when faced with two major setbacks. On the more technical side, we learned a lot more about Streamlit, Python, Git, PHP, and general web hosting. 

## What's Next for Sylvio's Sailing Kit 🎯
We want Sylvio's Sailing Kit to have increased utility with the addition of "tools" that would provide utility via computer vision, machine learning, time series analysis, etc. Also, we would like to build some more games for Sylvio's arcade.
