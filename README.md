## Inspiration 🧜‍♀️
We were inspired by the idea of a modern lonely sailor. We thought to ourselves "What would this sailor need to fulfill his navigation needs and thirst for a word puzzle."

## What it does🚢 🌧
Our project gathers real-time weather data to map out the most optimal path to get from one port to another.

## How we built it ❓
The wordle-inspired "seaWorldLE" was built using PHP, CSS, a word bank, and HTML to blend the backend and front-end problems faced when making a game like Wordle.

## Challenges we ran into😕
We ran into data collection issues at the start that made us rethink how we went about our project, additionally, in the mini-game seaWorldLE, we ran into issues with hosting a PHP website. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of😁
We're proud of the way we were able to recover from harsh setbacks in the beginning and rethink how we went about collecting our data to re-engineer our initial idea which was image classification of shark species as well as a predictive model that used data from buoy centers.

## What we learned
Functionally we learned how to constantly reinvigorate our imaginations when faced with two major setbacks. On the more technical side, we learned a lot more about StreamLit, Python, and PHP as well as general web hosting. 

## What's Next for Sylvio's Sailing Kit ⚓ 🔱⛵🚢 🌧
We want Sylvios's Sailing Kit to have increased utility with the addition of "tools" that would provide utility via computer vision, machine learning, time series analysis, etc.
